            <h1>My Testimony</h1>
            <br>
        <p>In my short but full life thus far, I have learned a small handful of things that make my life a happy life. I feel like I grew up pretty fast compared to a lot of people. And because of the many circumstances and events in my life I have learned a lot of lessons that I feel most don't learn until they are older. I enjoy sharing my insights with all those around me and am exicted to take this opportunity to share some of the most important things that I have learned about my Savior Jesus Christ and his gospel.</p> </center>
       <ol>
        <li>Jesus loves us so much we will never be alone.</li>
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>When we are at our most vulnerable and sad, he is with us. Everyday he consistently chooses to take on our pains so that we will never have to be alone. No matter how terrible it is he stands with us through everything. I think often about how I feel when I see others in pain. When I think about how they must feel. Sometimes I even feel so bad for what they are going through that it brings me a sense of hopelessness too. Then I realize that Christ does this for all of us, he sees us the same way, he loves us so deeply that when we are in pain he hurts too. His love has no end, and because of that we will never be alone.</li>

        <li>We don't know half as much as we think we do.</li>
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The world we live in now is full of information. If we have a question we can look it up and get an answer in 10 seconds. Yet despite how much we think we know, there is so much that we have yet to discover. The gospel teaches us that at times we have to trust a power that is way bigger than what we can comprehend. Sometimes the best thing for us to do is to trust God and put our lives in his hands. We don't need to know everything that will happen right now. Paitence in learning is very important. Take the time to find the answers yourself and it will deepen your understanding and faith. I don't need to know everything, or even a lot. I just need to follow God.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Along with that, it is okay not to know. Wait and pray and trust and God will lead you exactly where you are meant to go. You will find out where that is when you get there. Be flexible and adaptable, but continue forward in a path until God corrects you. When you are driving a car, you can't change directions unless the car is already moving forward. It is the same with God, he can't move us in the right direction unless we are already moving. Stay humble and press forward.</li>

            <br>
        <li>Remember that the end goal is to find joy and happiness.</li>
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Find joy in this world. God gives us commandments to warn us about what things in this world will lead to eternal joy and what things will lead us down a short path of satisfaction that fades quickly. As we will within the bounds that God has created for us we will find more joy and happiness. However, living the gospel does not mean we cannot enjoy the beautiful thrills that the world has to offer us. It is about finding a balence in our lives that allows us to live a joyful life that is focused on our Savior. We must not let the joys of the world overshadow our commitment and love for our Savior and Heavenly Father. The world was created for us to be able to find joy. Do not forget to look for it. Finding that joy for me, isn't the same as how other people find it and probably won't be the same for you either. And that is perfectly okay.</li>
